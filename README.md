# FitnessLogger
FYP

Welcome to my fitness logger, the following are instructions on how to install and use the application

1) Install the app-debug.apk file located in the FitnessLogger file (main file that contains the readme)
2) Once the application has installed, use the microphone button to activate voice recognition
3) State an exercise e.g. 30 push-ups, 15 squats, etc
4) View your exercises
5) From here you can click your exercise which will enable you to update it or delete it
6) Once you've done one of those action you will be redirected back to the home page

This app was built using Kotlin within the Android Studio IDE, with an SQLite database supporting the internal storage of the exercises in the back-end
